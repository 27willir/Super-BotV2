## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding New Keywords

car_keywords = [
    'firebird', 'camaro', 'corvette', 'mustang', 'charger', 'challenger', 
    'trans am', 'gto', 'nova', 'chevelle', 'impala', 'monte carlo',
    # Add your keywords here
    'your_new_keyword'
]
```

### Customizing Price Ranges

Modify the price range logic in the `save_listing` function:

```python
if price < 5000:
    price_range = "Under $5K"
elif price < 10000:
    price_range = "$5K-$10K"
# Add more ranges as needed
```

### Chart Customization

The charts use Chart.js and can be customized by modifying the chart configurations in `analytics.html`.
