# Scraper Threading Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Inconsistent Driver Management ✅
**Problem**: Facebook scraper created its own driver while others didn't use drivers at all.

**Solution**:
- Created centralized driver management in `scraper_thread.py`
- Added `_create_driver()`, `_cleanup_driver()`, and `_cleanup_all_drivers()` functions
- All drivers are now tracked in `_drivers` dictionary
- Consistent driver lifecycle management across all scrapers

### 2. Poor Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: No proper cleanup of drivers on errors, basic exception handling.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks in all scraper threads
- Implemented proper driver cleanup in `finally` blocks
- Added timeout handling for thread joins (5 seconds)
- Enhanced error logging with specific error messages
- Added graceful shutdown handling for KeyboardInterrupt

### 3. Thread Safety Issues ✅
**Problem**: Shared resources like `seen_listings` were not thread-safe.

**Solution**:
- Added `threading.Lock()` for each scraper's `seen_listings` dictionary
- Protected all read/write operations with lock context managers
- Added thread locks for driver management (`_thread_locks`)
- Ensured atomic operations on shared state

### 4. Memory Leaks ✅
**Problem**: Drivers not properly cleaned up, threads not terminating properly.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper driver cleanup in all scenarios
- Added `stop_all_scrapers()` function for global cleanup
- Enhanced thread termination with proper timeout handling
- Added memory usage monitoring in test script
- Implemented proper resource cleanup in error scenarios

## Key Improvements Made

### Centralized Driver Management
```python
# New functions in scraper_thread.py
def _create_driver(site_name):
    """Create and track a new driver for the given site."""
    
def _cleanup_driver(site_name):
    """Safely cleanup driver for the given site."""
    
def _cleanup_all_drivers():
    """Cleanup all active drivers."""
```

### Thread Safety
```python
# Added to each scraper
_seen_listings_lock = threading.Lock()

# Protected operations
with _seen_listings_lock:
    seen_listings[link] = datetime.now()
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```python
def run_facebook_scraper(driver, flag_name="facebook"):
    try:
        while running_flags.get(flag_name, True):
            try:
                check_facebook(driver)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"❌ Error in Facebook scraper iteration: {e}")
                continue
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("🛑 Facebook scraper interrupted by user")
    finally:
        print("🛑 Facebook scraper stopped")
```

### Global Cleanup Functions
```python
def stop_all_scrapers():
    """Stop all running scrapers and cleanup resources."""
    
def get_scraper_status():
    """Get status of all scrapers."""
```

## Testing

Created `test_scraper_stability.py` to verify:
- Scraper lifecycle (start/stop)
- Memory usage monitoring
- Error handling resilience
- Thread safety

## Impact

✅ **Memory Leaks Fixed**: Proper driver cleanup prevents memory accumulation
✅ **Crashes Reduced**: Enhanced error handling prevents thread crashes
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Standardized driver management across all scrapers
✅ **Thread Safety**: Protected shared resources with proper locking
✅ **Better Monitoring**: Added status checking and logging

## Files Modified

1. `scraper_thread.py` - Centralized driver management and thread control
2. `scrapers/facebook.py` - Thread safety and error handling
3. `scrapers/craigslist.py` - Thread safety and error handling  
4. `scrapers/ksl.py` - Thread safety and error handling
5. `test_scraper_stability.py` - Stability testing script

The scraper threading issues have been comprehensively resolved with proper driver management, thread safety, error handling, and memory leak prevention.
